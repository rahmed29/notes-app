// Yeah idk what I was thinking. These were definitely not secure and should never have been used to store anything that truly needed to be encrypted.
// For stuff that really needs to be secure, a secure note on bitwarden or something like that is great.
// So I am going to remove the "encrypted notes" features but I'm lazy so I don't want to go and remove all occurences of it so I'll just make these dummy function I guess
